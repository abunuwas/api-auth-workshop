## What are SQLAlchemy and Alembic?

**SQLAlchemy** is Python's most popular Object Relational Mapper (ORM). 
ORMs are frameworks that offer an object-oriented interface to your 
database tables. ORMs give you a layer of abstraction on top of SQL, 
so you don't have to write SQL queries by hand - instead, you just write
code. ORMs also abstract away the differences between SQL engines, such
as PostgreSQL and MySQL, so you can switch between one and the other 
without having to change your code. You can learn more about SQLAlchemy
with its official documentation: https://www.sqlalchemy.org/.

**Alembic** is a database migrations management framework. Alembic ensures
that your database schemas accurately reflect the data models that you 
define with SQLAlchemy. You can learn more about Alembic with its official
documentation: https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/.
